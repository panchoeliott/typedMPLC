notes
TypeCheck after CT
or
TypeCheck after eval(alpha)

evalDL Only occurs after evalCT so no DownA or UpA exist in terms evaluated in evalDL 

A program (Expression) is run using --CT--> --RT--> hence all downA and UpA are removed in CT so an error is thrown for evalRT (UpA ...)

A good test is 
--UL-->--DL--> == Identity at runtime 
similarly 
--DL-->--UL--> == Identity at runtime (for valid terms (AST Terms)

This is a good test to ensure things are working correctly.

evalDL (AST [TagExpr TVar, x]) does not evaluate x recursively but UpA and DownA have been removed in CT hence 
evalDL (AST [TagExpr TVar, DownA (AST [TagExpr TPromote, TagExpr TVarRep, AST[TagExpr TVarRep, VarRep "x"]])]) 
cannot be evaluated at RT but can be at CT
